"""
    There are three common ways to traverse a tree in depth-first order:

    1. In-order
    2. Pre-order
    3. Post-order
    Letâ€™s begin with the Pre-order Traversal.

    Pre-order Traversal-----------------------------------------------
    
    Here is the algorithm for a pre-order traversal:
    1. Check if the current node is empty/null.
    2. Display the data part of the root (or current node).
    3. Traverse the left subtree by recursively calling the pre-order method.
    4. Traverse the right subtree by recursively calling the pre-order method.
